</p>

[CodeFlare](https://codeflare.dev) is a framework to simplify the
integration, scaling and acceleration of complex multi-step analytics
and machine learning pipelines on the cloud.

This repository is home to the open source CodeFlare CLI,
`codeflare`. On macOS, you can [get started
immediately](#installation) using `brew install`.

| `codeflare` guides you via a series of questions. Where is your code? Where is your data? How many GPUs do you need? | You may name the set of answers you provided. We call this a **profile**. Your inner loop then becomes: `codeflare -y -p <profileName>`. The `-y` means accept all prior answers. | `codeflare` offers quick access to MLFlow, Tensorboard, and a custom dashboard that tracks the resource consumption and logs of a job. |
| `codeflare` glues answers together and submits a Kubernetes job.                                                     | You can switch quickly between profiles, and even submit jobs to distinct profiles concurrently.                                                                                  | There is no need to fiddle with yaml files and port forwards. With a few clicks, you will get a popup dashboard window.                |

## Tray Menu

<img align="right" width="275" src="docs/images/tray/activeruns.png">

The CodeFlare tray menu offers quick access to the most common
features. On macOS and Linux, the menu will appear the upper right of
your menubar, as shown in the screenshot to the right.

To launch the CodeFlare tray menu from your terminal, try `codeflare hello`. You should now see a `CF` tray menu.

## Installation

On macOS, if you have [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) installed:

    brew tap project-codeflare/codeflare-cli https://github.com/project-codeflare/codeflare-cli
