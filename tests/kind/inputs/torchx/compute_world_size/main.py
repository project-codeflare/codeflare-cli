Compute World Size Example
============================

This is a minimal "hello world" style  example application that uses
PyTorch Distributed to compute the world size. It does not do ML training
but it does initialize process groups and performs a single collective operation (all_reduce)
which is enough to validate the infrastructure and scheduler setup.

As simple as this application is, the actual ``compute_world_size()`` function is
split into a separate submodule (``.module.util.compute_world_size``) to double
as a E2E test for workspace patching logic, which typically diff-patches a full project
directory rather than a single file. This application also uses `Hydra <https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/>`_
configs as an expository example of how to use Hydra configs in an application that launches with TorchX.

Run it with the ``dist.ddp`` builtin component to use as a validation application
to ensure that the stack has been setup properly for more serious distributed training jobs.
